# WebAssembly System Interface (For Your Information)

This site serves the test results of running the [wasi-test-suite](https://github.com/caspervonb/wasi-test-suite) over these WebAssembly enabled runtimes:
- Deno
- Node
- Wasmtime
- Wasmer

The raw data is generated automatically on a nightly basis with the latest release of each runtime against the HEAD of the test suite repository and is [stored in this repository](https://github.com/caspervonb/wasi-test-data).
